# Word-by-word-translator
Word-by-word-translator is an end course project of Java class at "Centre de Techniques de Planification et d'Economie Appliqu√©e" - CTPEA in September 2021.
This app help to translate sentence word by word in three languages : French, Englisn and .
It contains it own dictionnaries (French, English and Spanish) in a file, in which we can add a new word or delete an existing word.
It's not a complete project with no limit. We can perform it by using a SQL Database instead of files for the dictionnaries for example.
